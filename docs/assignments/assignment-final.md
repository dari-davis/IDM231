# IDM231 Final Project

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Final Project

Students will create their own custom zodiac web page based upon the Zodiac Algorithm to be delivered online. This custom zodiac web page will let the user enter any valid birth date and then compute the correct response according to the western zodiac system for that date. The user should see and hear unique renditions of their particular zodiac sign. The user should also be given the option to re-enter birth dates. This program should display all functional zodiac sign buttons just in case the user does not wish to enter their birth date. This program should also have a help screen that clearly defines how the web page works.

Your final project represents the culmination of past ten weeks.  This project will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. Code Quality
    - Is all of your code valid?
    - Did you follow best practices regarding file names, characters, coding styles?
    - Is your code legible and easy to navigate?
    - Does your code use comments?
1. Functionality
    - Everything needs to work (e.g. links, videos, audio, images, rollovers etc.). If it's part of your site it must be working properly.
1. Design
    - Is your site visually pleasing?
    - Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
    - Would you feel comfortable using this project in a job interview as an example of your skills?

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Final Project**:

1. A link to your self hosted website project page. From this page, I can fully engage the project and have access to all supplementary pages and functions.
1. A link to your GitHub repository containing the code for your final project. Remember: a well maintained repository does not include binary files, but these files are essential to your project. Host the files on your server and use documentation within your project to include references and links for downloads of critical binary files.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
